# CV2-Tutorial
See the following guide for the basics of OpenCV, which explains how to get started, and some of the idiosyncrasies associated with using CV2 on different platforms (Linux/Windows). The tutorial leaves out many useful functions which are already present in the documentation, which should be referred to and read through in full after working through this tutorial.

Feel free to make any changes/updates to the associated .tex file
